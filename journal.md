# April 28
This is the first real entry in the journal, as for the most part i haven't quite had the time to work on the project, however, for the first time i actually feel motivated to work on it. Call it something to do with the new keyboard. 

For today, I want to work on the lab to do with jekyll/static website builders, i intend on trying out a couple of them, ive heard quite a bit about Hugo, so I might try that one as well. Another goal of mine for the future that more has to do withe something I am interested in learning is integrating a database into my website, so that I can have database of open source keyboard as well as a simple script to add a new keyboard into the list. With this database, I hope to have a page on the site that has to do with a list of open source keyboards that can be found on github. keyboards such as the dactyl manuform and the ergodox.

# TODO:
This section will be updated overtime during the project:

- Learn about databases and integrating them into static websites (if that is even possible)
- Add sources / websites visted to this document
