This is the first real entry in the journal, as for the most part i haven't quite had the time to work on the project, however, for the first time i actually feel motivated to work on it. Call it something to do with the new keyboard. 

For today, I want to work on the lab to do with jekyll/static website builders, i intend on trying out a couple of them, ive heard quite a bit about Hugo, so I might try that one as well. Another goal of mine for the future that more has to do withe something I am interested in learning is integrating a database into my website, so that I can have database of open source keyboard as well as a simple script to add a new keyboard into the list. With this database, I hope to have a page on the site that has to do with a list of open source keyboards that can be found on github. keyboards such as the dactyl manuform and the ergodox.

# TODO:
This section will be updated overtime during the project:

- Learn about databases and integrating them into static websites (if that is even possible)
- Add sources / websites visted to this document

I've sort-of been working on the website, mostly just experimenting with new themes and changing things around, however, I find myself a little unhappy with many of the different themes that I have tried. In addition to this, I want to give myself more of a personal challenge and attempt to run my site using a different static website builder than jekyll. I'm currently leaning towards Hugo as a lot of the themes of it that I have seen appeal to me. In addition to this, i have realized that the idea of a database is a little too complex for now as I don't see a straightforward way of implementing it. However, still wanting to do something different, I have decided that I will attempt to use docker and run most of the services in containers. I personally find that containers are very useful when managing multiple services on my own server and would like to implement that into the VPS.
