<p>This is where things get more complicated and frankly, more angering than anything. In the custom keyboard world, there are three ways to get parts, Group buys (GB), the after market as well as in-stock. Group Buys are the most common of the three and are oftentimes the most associated with the custom mechanical keyboard community.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-group-buy">What is a group buy?</h1>

<p>Group buys (GBs) are run by designers/companies. Oftentimes in the case of developpers, they will run them off of small forums such as <a href="https://geekhack.org/">geekhack</a>. Companies will oftentimes run these group buys off of their site as well as advertiste them on geekhack as well. Group buys all essentially boil down to a couple of stages. The first is an Interest Check (IC) where the group buy runner will post a form to geekhack essentially trying to figure out if there is a big enough market for their product, as well as any feedback on the mockup of the product itself. Keep in mind that oftentimes a this stage, there is not even a single unit of the product. If an IC garners enough attention, this is when they will start taking orders for the product. There are different types of group buys:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unlimited</li>
  <li>First Come First Serve / Limited</li>
  <li>Raffle</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlimited group buys as the name suggests are unlimited, for the most part, the group buy runner will go to the manufacturer and order a certain amount of units exact to the amount of orders (plus a couple of units for defects). On the other hand, first come first serve GBs have a limit on how many units can be sold, usually ranging from 100-1000, with most landing around 500 units. This means that only the first x amount of people will be allowed to order, essentially making the product more scarce. However, nothing is as scarce as the raffle GBs, which usually only have &lt; 100 unit. Unlike the first come first serve ones however, you only have the chance to buy the product if you win this raffle at a very low chance.</p>

<p>Group buys come with even more caveats however, as there is never a guarantee of even getting the product, if a designer really wanted, they could just take the thousands of dollars of orders and just run with the money, in practice however, this is very uncommon. This leaves most group buys that will only deliver a product about a year later, this accounts for the time it takes to process orders, put in the order to the actual manufacturer, manufactur the units, then for the designer/company to receive the units and then to ship them all out.</p>

<p>This begs the question, <em>what is the point of participating in a group buy?</em> the answer is simple, you get a product that is very limited, that will most likely never come out again and these group buys are oftentimes very high quality products. Another aspect of this can be seen as an investment. For example, a standard GMK Keycap set will be about US$130.00 during a GB, but once it is out and it starts to show up on the aftermarket, those sets can easily double in price. This brings us to the next way of buying products, the aftermarket.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-aftermarket">What is the aftermarket?</h1>

<p>The aftermarket is in reference to individuals selling products they’ve purchased to to other individuals, this can be in the form of used parts or brand new unopened parts. The most common aftermarket is the subreddit /r/MechMarket, where dozens of posts are made by individuals selling products every day. There are other aftermarkets other places, such as on the geekhack forum. The aftermarket is appealing to people because while the prices are often much higher than they were during the initial group buy, the aftermarket guarantees that the product is in-hand, meaning that you won’t be waiting an entire year to receive what you paid for.</p>

<p>However, this convenience comes at a very big price. For example, one of my personal “dream keyboards” is a Kyuu, which ran as a group buy in 2018 for US$500. Certain rare version of this keyboard are now selling for upwards of US$2000 on the aftermarket, hence why it really is a “dream keyboard”. For some, this is seen as an investment, and they will buy up many group buys just to sell them on the aftermarket later. A good example of this is the keycap set GMK Striker which sold for 130$, and due to a popular internet personality building a keyboard with it, the keycap sets popularity rose and it was seen on the aftermarket for more than triple the original price.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-in-stock">What is in-stock?</h1>

<p>As the name suggests, in-stock products / parts are for the most part in stock, are in continous production and oftentimes are more mass-produced than products in a GB. These parts tend to also be slightly cheaper than the group buy parts because it is easier to produce many of them. There are various retailers that offer keyboard parts, such as 1UPKeyboards, KBDFans, KPRepublic, NovelKeys and many, many more. A lot of these companies also offer the occasional group buy that is very popular. These in-stock parts are much more similar to purchasing something like car or computer parts and are much more easily accesible. The only drawback is that they tend to be more generic and to carry less value than GB products. However, for a begginner in the hobby, this is the way to go.</p>
