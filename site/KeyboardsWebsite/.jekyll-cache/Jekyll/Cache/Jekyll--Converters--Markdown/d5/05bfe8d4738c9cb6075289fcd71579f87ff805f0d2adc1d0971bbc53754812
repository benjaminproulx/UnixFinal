I"u<p>Keyboards being the multifaceted tool that they are means that different people using them will demand different things from them, some people, such as GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard">TaranVH</a>, require many more keys than most need, while others like the push the boundaries of the bare minimum such as GitHub user uuupah who created the <a href="https://github.com/uuupah/pain27">pain27</a>, a keyboard with only the letters of the alphabet and a spacebar. Others prefer to use ergonomic keyboards to prevent RSI and other injuries that can arise from regular keyboards, one of my personal favorite of these is the <a href="https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform">Dactyl ManuForm</a>. For the simplicity of this site, we will only be able to cover some of the infinite layouts that are available, as well as the pros and cons for each.</p>
