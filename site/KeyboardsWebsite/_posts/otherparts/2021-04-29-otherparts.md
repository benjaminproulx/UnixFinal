# Other Parts

While switches are the most complex and nuanced parts that keyboards have, there are many other parts that can obviously not be overlooked, in this section I will go over all the other parts that make a keyboard a keyboard as well as provide examples for each of them.

# The case

To some, the case is the most important part of the keyboard as it changes the look of the entire thing. This is essentially the building block upon which all your other parts (PCB, Plate, etc) will be mounted. Cases are often the thing that determines the form factor of the keyboard that you are building. Very popular examples of cases that are all in-stock parts:

- KDFans Tofu60/65/75
- Generic Injection Molded Case

Keep in mind, that some cases will oftentimes include other parts such as the PCB, Plate, Stabilizers, this is the case with the NovelKeys NK65 Entry/Aluminum editions. The case also plays a major role in the sound of the keyboard, depending on the mounting type that is designed. The main mounting types are:

- Tray Mount
- Gasket Mount
- Integrated Plate Mount
- Bottom Mount
- Top Mount

# The PCB

The PCB is what you mount your switches too and is the brains of the keyboard, and will be what determines your layout. PCB's now come in too flavors, solder PCBs and hotswap PCBs. The latter is a recent development in the mechanical keyboard community and is rapidly gaining popularity as it makes it very easy to build as well as provide a quick and easy way to try out different switches without having to desolder an entire board. Solder PCBs require you to solder the switches onto the PCB, making it very hard to change switches later down the road. Popular examples of these PCBs are:

- KBDFans DZ60
- GH60 Satan
- 1UP RGB 60% PCB

# Plate

The plate is a piece of material that goes in between your PCB and your switches. Plates essentially make sure that all the switches are in the right place, as well as provide a more rigid unit once completeted. Plates also play a part in the sound of the keyboard depending on the material, with popular plate materials being:

- Aluminium
- Brass
- Carbon Fiber
- Polycarbonate

Aluminium plates tend to be the most standard of the bunch providing a good price/performance ratio, sounding about average and being rigid enough while not breaking the bank. These are often what you will find in many prebuilt boards as they are very common.
Brass plates are rather expensive compared to their aluminium counterparts, but provide a much more rigid experience while adding weight to the board, something that many people value. They also provide a more consistent sound to the aluminium plates.
Carbon Fiber and Polycarbonate plates are often picked because they are flexibe and provide a much "softer" typing experience to the user, they also tend to provide a deeper sound than the other plates.

# Stabilizers

Stabilizers are found on keyboards to make the larger keys (shift, enter, backspace, space) more stable, without them, your spacebar would feel extremely wobbly and would not actuate if hit on the far right or far left. Stabilizers also have a large effect on how these larger keys sound. Stabilizers are probably the component that tends to need the most work into it to sound good, there is a lengthy process to getting these stabilizers to sound as good as they can, a process that is well documented by one of the larger faces in the keyboard community, [TaehaTypes](https://youtu.be/usNx1_d0HbQ). He explains the whole process in depth and with great precision. Stabilizers will oftentimes come with your PCB but if ommited, you can purchase higher quality ones from the like of Durock, Zeal or GMK.
